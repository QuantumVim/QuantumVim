# QuantumVim

My personal configuration adapted from [LunarVim](https://github.com/LunarVim/LunarVim)

## Disclaimer

I copied and adapted a lot of the code from the [LunarVim](https://github.com/LunarVim/LunarVim) project because my goal is to learn Lua and I believe that the mentioned project uses a lot of good best practices that I can get value from. I have no intentions of making my IDE available and scalable. When you are looking for an easy solution to get you a very sophisticated neovim IDE up and running - go checkout [LunarVim](https://github.com/LunarVim/LunarVim). The only reason I added a license to this project is that I used [LunarVim](https://github.com/LunarVim/LunarVim) as an entry point to get startd and their license requires you to do so.
